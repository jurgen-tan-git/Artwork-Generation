            [UC Berkeley](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~taesung_park/CycleGAN/datasets/) and other open sourced datasets on Kaggle.
            If you're interested in the code behind the project, the project is hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/bear96/cyclegan-vangogh).
            Alternatively, you can choose to clone into the repository using

contained pictures of scenery, hence this handicap.""")

    *Vincent Van Gogh, the red-haired Dutch master of the paintbrush, was a genius whose artistic
